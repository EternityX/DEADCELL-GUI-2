# DEADCELL-GUI-2
### NOTICE I will set up a working example and build process when I get the time.

---

### Event-driven UI library for gamehacking. ImGui handles the platform and rendering independent code.
Rewrite of [DEADCELL-GUI](https://github.com/EternityX/DEADCELL-GUI) but much more feature complete. This is purely GUI code, nothing else.

## Features
- Event-driven
- Flex-box like layout model
- Support for multiple windows
- Modal/popout windows
- Blur shader for title bar (DX11 only)

## Usage
See [menu.cpp](https://github.com/EternityX/DEADCELL-GUI-2/blob/main/gui/menu.cpp) for an example.

## Preview
Images are slightly outdated but the general design is the same
