# DEADCELL-GUI-2
### Event-driven UI library for gamehacking. Platform and rendering independent code is handled by ImGui.
Rewrite of [DEADCELL-GUI](https://github.com/EternityX/DEADCELL-GUI) but much more feature complete. This is purely GUI code, nothing else.

## Features
- Event driven
- Flex-box like layout model
- Support for multiple windows
- Modal/popout windows
- Blur shader for titlebar (DX11 only)

## Usage
See [menu.cpp](https://github.com/EternityX/DEADCELL-GUI-2/blob/main/gui/menu.cpp) for an example.
