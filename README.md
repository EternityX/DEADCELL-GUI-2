# DEADCELL-GUI-2
Continuation of [DEADCELL-GUI](https://github.com/EternityX/DEADCELL-GUI) but more feature complete. This is purely GUI code, nothing else, but based off the first version.
If you are curious to see what the design looks like, I suggest viewing [DEADCELL-GUI](https://github.com/EternityX/DEADCELL-GUI) and scrolling to the bottom as this project is an attempt at recreating that design.

### I (EternityX) do not permit others to use my intellectual property (DEADCELL), or other identifying marks or designs (this includes whole imitations). You may also not cover or obscure any part of the designs. Any other intellectual propery such as the skin images (found in the skins tab) or artwork (found within the scripts tab) of the design are not my property and is fair-use. This notice can be changed at any time.
